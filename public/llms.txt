## Key Case Studies

### 1. Conversational Insights (Google Ads)
- **Role**: Lead Product Designer
- **Problem**: Small business owners (SMBs) are overwhelmed by complex data dashboards. They don't want to parse metrics; they want actionable answers to questions like "Why did my sales drop?"
- **Solution (Agentic AI)**: Designed a specialized conversational agent that acts as a Chief Marketing Officer for SMBs. It allows users to query data via natural language. The system synthesizes the data and provides generative, actionable answers, converting raw analytics into direct strategy.

- **Problem**: Creating high-quality video content is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for small merchants, creating a major barrier to advertising on platforms like YouTube.
- **Solution**: Led the design of "ShopStream," an AI-powered pipeline that allows merchants to generate and iterate on promotional video assets instantly using text-to-video and image-to-video generative models.
- **Outcome**: The feature powered over 80% of Performance Max (PMax) GenAI video revenue and directly drove >$5.2M in incremental revenue in 2024.

### 3. Merchant Communications (Google Maps & Search)
- **Role**: Lead Product Designer
- **Problem**: Consumers needed a unified, trusted way to contact businesses directly through Google platforms, but the legacy infrastructure was fragmented and localized.
- **Solution**: Drove the end-to-end UX vision for global messaging across Google Search and Maps. Designed a surface-agnostic "Communication as a Service" platform that standardized consumer UX and opened the ecosystem to 3rd-party integrations.
- **Outcome**: Launched Calls, Messaging, and Photos to 13M+ verified users globally, achieving an 80% CSAT score.
