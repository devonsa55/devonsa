# Task Completion Note

I was unable to send a standard notification due to a tool availability issue (`notify_user` failing).

I have successfully completed your request to update the About page:

1.  **Moved the image to the top**: In `src/components/About.tsx`, the profile image is now the first element in the header section.
2.  **Updated content**: Changed the headline to **"Hey, I'm Devon."** and centered it using `SectionHeader` props and CSS.
3.  **Removed philosophy**: Deleted the "Philosophy" section content from `src/components/About.tsx`.
4.  **Refined styling**: Updated `src/styles/components/AboutRedesign.css` to target `h2` instead of `h1` for the header, ensuring proper styling and responsiveness.

**Next Steps:**
Please resolve the `node_modules` permission issue to run the prototype and view these changes. The `npm install` command I suggested earlier should fix this.
